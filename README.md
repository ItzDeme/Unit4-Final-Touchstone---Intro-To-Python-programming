# Unit4-Final-Touchstone---Intro-To-Python-programming
# The program will act as a tracker for transferable classes for WGU that need to be finished, vs classes that have already been completed.
# I want to create something thatâ€™s convenient and intuitive for use.
# I have created a template of classes that can be taken from other online schools. The user will need to supply their name and where they took the class and the class name they wish to transfer.
# Users will be able to read/write their own files, based off the template provided.Users will need to enter data or use the available options to read data.
# Users will be able to see the classes they need and update the classes they have taken.
